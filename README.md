<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

### Description
Mobile task list app based off the Scrimba shopping list mobile app. You can add a task to your task list and delete a task when finished by pressing on the task. 
The app is connected to the real-time database Firebase, so it saves tasks even when you leave the app. 

**Note: I am not associated with Scrimba, it is one of the resources that I am using currently to learn Javascript**

### Motivation
For me, task lists and to-do lists are essential in making sure I get things done. I thought this application would be useful for adding tasks as you think of them and then deleting them/checking them off when completed. 

Since this app is mobile, you can take it on the go and add tasks whenever you think of them (I tend to think of tasks at random times, so having the ability to add them immediately to your task list is really helpful to me). 

I used a pastel color theme and a cartoon cat for the image because things with a cute aesthetic motivate me to use them more :D

### Reflection
With this project, I learned how to:
- use Firebase to create a realtime database, connect, and reference it in your code
- import and export Javascript functions
- use favicons so the site shows an icon in the browser tab
- use event listeners to listen for clicks
- use .createElement() to create HTML elements
- deploy the project on netlify and add the mobile app to my phone homepage

### Built With

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### 2 ways
#### Method 1: Use current database (my database)
**Note: Anyone can edit the firebase database at the moment. If you see changes you did not make, that means someone else is using the app.
Use method 2 to avoid this**
Go to the [netlify site](https://genuine-snickerdoodle-caefed.netlify.app/) where the app is deployed. Once opened you can go ahead and use it on the browser!

If you want to add it to your mobile homescreen:
1) Open your default browser app (for Android this is Google Chrome)
2) Go to the [netlify site](https://genuine-snickerdoodle-caefed.netlify.app/) while in your browser
3) Open the menu (3 dots on top right for Android)

4) Press "add to home screen"

5) Give the app a description

6) Find the app on your mobile phone and begin adding tasks! To remove a task/mark as completed, simply press on the task.

#### Method 2: Use the app with your own firebase database:
1) Download the repository
2) Create your [Firebase database](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
3) Replace 'database URL' link with your own Firebase link in 'index.js'

4) Deploy on [netlify](https://app.netlify.com/)
5) Follow Method 1 steps to add to your mobile device
